# The am and pm were switched on the google invite so I have to go to this bikepdx hack night because it is the last event before the turn in date on calagator
## Bike riding safety ideas
* They need to have clear guidance that you can narrow a roadway so that people can give bicyclists more room on the road.
* People think that roads are unnecessarily wide for cars
* Expanding slow streets to major roadways so that people have more room and and better routes for bicyclists to have easier network style riding.
## Honestly I have no idea what they are talking about
* As someone who is not involved in the biking community I am hearing a lot terms that are new to me. "ways?" (maybe an app)
* There are some barricades or something that arent good enough for these bicyclists.
# PBOT
## Portland Bureau of Transportation
* Not an app.  Thought it was because they talk about PBOT as if it is an app.  They have a lot of proposals for PBOT.
# Volunteer Program
* Checking installations of some kind
* Observing how to add more GreenWays
# Neal Armstrong (actual name)
* Head of the volunteer program where you place barrels on the greenway
* Not very high up in the PBOT food chain
